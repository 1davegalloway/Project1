Project Title:
Car Safety in Missouri

Description:
Looking at the comparisons of safety reports of various vehicle crash fatalities and injuries.
Key factors: Age (Young vs. Mature), Alcohol Involvement, Speed, Motorcycle

Hypothesis:
H0 = There is no change in vehicle safety through the years.
H1 = Vehicle safety has improved through the years.
H2 = Vehicle safety has gotten worse through the years.

Data:
Car Safety Data
Missouri Highway State Patrol

Unused-
IIHS API - https://api.iihs.org/ - did not work
NHTSA API - https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api - little documentation
https://webapi.nhtsa.gov/Default.aspx?SafetyRatings/API/5

Initial Questions:
What factors make the most dangerous driver?
How do autonomous cars compare?
How does driver education affect crash/safety data?

Techniques and Tools:
Python, Pandas, JSON, Matplotlib

Data Shortcomings:
Available Data
Is there a standardized safety measurement standard?
Simulated vs Actual crashes comparison
Speed Limit and infrastructure factors
Manual vs Automatic
Age limitations
