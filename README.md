Project Title:
Car Safety Comparison between Country Manufacturers

Description:
Looking at the comparisons of safety reports of various vehicle manufacturers across a few key countries.
Key Countries: USA, Germany, Japan, India
Key Manufacturers: Tesla

Hypothesis:
H0 = There is no difference in safety standards and results across countries.
H1 = There is a statistically observable difference in safety standards and results across countries.
H2 = Germany has statistically observable better safety standards and results compared to the other studied countries.
H3 = Japan has statistically observable better safety standards and results compared to the other studied countries.
H4 = USA has statistically observable better safety standards and results compared to the other studied countries.

Data:
Car Safety Data (source pending, NHTSA)
IIHS API - https://api.iihs.org/
NHTSA API - https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/

Initial Questions:
Which countries have the safest cars?
How do autonomous cars compare?
Do some countries do certain vehicle types better?
How does driver education affect crash/safety data in countries?

Techniques and Tools:
Python, Pandas, JSON, Matplotlib

Data Shortcomings:
Available Data
Is there a standardized safety measurement standard? (USA vs Finland)
Simulated vs Actual crashes comparison
Speed Limit and infrastructure factors
Manual vs Automatic
Age limitations
